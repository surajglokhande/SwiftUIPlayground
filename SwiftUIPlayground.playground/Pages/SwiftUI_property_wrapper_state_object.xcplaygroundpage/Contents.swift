 ## StateObject
 > @StateObject is used to store new instances of reference type data that conforms to the ObservableObject protocol. This owns its data.

 SwiftUIâ€™s @StateObject property wrapper is designed to fill a very specific gap in state management: when you need to create a reference type inside one of your views and make sure it stays alive for use in that view and others you share it with.

 If you want to use that inside various views, you either need to create it externally to SwiftUI and inject it in, or create it inside one of your SwiftUI views and use @StateObject

 **Important**: You should use @StateObject only once per object, which should be in whichever view is responsible for creating the object. All other views that share your object should use @ObservedObject.
